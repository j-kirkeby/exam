                <h2 id="#section-1">Applications of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p class="end-space">Big data and artificial intelligence can be used to support a variety of functions and tasks and is
                    being adopted in many different fields. In this section, you will get to know some
                    of the ways big data and artificial intelligence is used in society.</p>
                <h3>How do machine learning algorithms work?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Takes in a data set</li>
                    <li>Creates a model</li>
                    <li>The new model is used on new data</li>
                    <li>The model tries to predict future outcomes:
                        Given the data set, what would we expect to happen?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Big data has created an explosion in machine learning because of the large number of data the models
                    can base their models on which makes for more accurate predictions.</p>
                <p class="definition">Algorithmic bias (definition): When computer systems reflect the implicit biases of
                    those who made them. This can enforce existing biases through algorithms because of how data has been
                    collected. </p>
                <p class="end-space">One of the applications of artificial intelligence is to identify the preferences of customers.
                    Media companies use this to present targeted content to their customers</p>
                <h3>How do AI-based recommendation systems work?</h3>
                <p>Recommendation systems use advanced AI algorithms to tell us what to buy through advertising, what
                    to watch on Netflix/Youtube, what to read on Facebook and what to listen to on Spotify.</p>
                <p class="end-space">These recommendations are usually personalised and based on your previous behaviour. Which has been
                    integrated as data in the system.</p>
                <h4>These systems can be broadly categorised into:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Collaborated filtering</b> - You may be asked for some of your favourite movies by Netflix, so they
                        can group you with other people of similar taste. You may have seen “Users who like this item,
                        also like this item [..]”</li>
                    <li><b>Content based recommendation systems</b> - Builds a personalised profile about each user
                        based on their behaviour.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="end-space">There have been raised privacy concerns about content based recommendation systems as it can be used
                    to build a detailed profile of each single user.</p>
                <!-- Start of Section 2 -->
                <h2 id="#section-2">Justice and Ethics in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence</h2>
                <p class="end-space">The use of artificial intelligence and big data in many different areas of society is posing new
                    ethical questions as well as invigorating dilemmas that humanity has been grappling with throughout
                    history.</p>
                <h3>Ethical questions in artificial intelligence</h3>
                <p>Who is responsible when an artificial intelligence system has to make an ethical decision? Imagine:
                    A self-driving car needs to make a decision between; 1. hitting a child in the road, 2. turning left
                    and hitting a man walking to work, or 3. turning right and hitting a wall, probably killing the driver.</p>
                <p class="end-space">The system designers will have to make a decision on how these situations are handled. Biases in the
                    data might also influence how the system acts in these situations.</p>
                <h4>IBM's principles for AI:</h4>
                <ol class="end-space">
                    <li><u>Man and machine working together</u> - It should not be only the machine making decisions.</li>
                    <li><u>Trust and openness</u> - The system should show why a decision was made.</li>
                    <li><u>Data ownership</u> - The people/company creating the data owns the data and is
                        responsible for it.</li>
                    <li><u>Competence</u> - People working with AI systems should have special competence in working
                        with these systems.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>The Turing Test</h3>
                <p>The Turing test is a test of whether a computer can pass as human, and is commonly considered to be
                    the ultimate indicator of success in the development of artificial intelligence. But do we really
                    want artificial intelligence to reason like human beings?</p>
                <p class="definition">Turing test (definition): A way of evaluating how good a machine is at doing a
                    particular task. The ultimate example of a machine is one that is mistaken for human.</p>
                <p class="end-space">This might not be the standard we want for artificial intelligence, as human beings can be very flawed.
                    We make mistakes and have inherent biases. I.e. gender and racial biases.</p>
                <h4>Biases that already exist in AI systems:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The way an algorithm is written introduces human bias</li>
                    <li>Biases in the data set the algorithm learns from</li>
                    <li>The way humans interpret the results</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Because of how machine learning works the 2nd point (biases in the data set) are especially important
                    and this might create self-reenforcing biases. For instance when it comes to recognising images.
                    Because of the dominance of American culture in relation to the population size, these images may be
                    overrepresented in the data set. The image of a bride recognised by a machine will be the white and
                    veiled bride common in the west, and not an Indian or Chinese brides and garments even though these
                    are more common.</p>
